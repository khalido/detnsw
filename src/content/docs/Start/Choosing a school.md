If you live near in or near a big city, your local public school is fine. Using the money (or time saved making that money) to do things with your kids will make them better off in the long run.

> International test results reveal Australian students perform no better academically if they attend a private school over a public school once socio-economic background is taken into account.

What you do as a parent matters more than where your kids go to school. Send your kids to your local public school, use the money you saved to travel and do things with your kids.

Perhaps the main choice you have in how their education goes is:

- choosing wealthy and nice enough parents to leave you some money or a house in a nice area.
- Making money and settling down in a area near a public school. 
- Setting aside some time and money to get involved (just a little bit) with your kids education and doing things with them

Everything else is just fiddling around the edges.
