Chromebooks are ideal for school, especially the [education models available through suppliers like LWT](https://school.orderportal.com.au/Welcome?ofid=131).  
  
:::tip[tl;dr]
everything students use runs on the web, and chromebooks are simple computers which are designed to only run web apps. 
:::
  
The only thing chromebooks lack is the ability to install old school apps and games - none of which a typical NSW school student uses.  
  
## Buying advice Feb '24  

For general school use (coding, writing, number crunching, basic robotics)

:::tip[Best value for money]
The current best value chromebook for students in from Y1 to ~Yr9 is the 
[Lenovo 500E G4 Yoga Chromebook](https://school.orderportal.com.au/CompareDevices?ofid=131&pids=5160095)  for A$649.
:::

This is a rugged, convertible touchscreen laptop with an active stylus and will last for years, and LWT sells replacement parts if it breaks. This handles all the web apps students use.

The cheapest value for money chromebook is:  
[Lenovo 100E G3 Chromebook - 11.6", Intel  ~$392.00](https://school.orderportal.com.au/CompareDevices?ofid=131&pids=3877399) (Gen 4 should be out soon) 
  
This will do all the jobs needed, is rugged, but doesn't flip and has no touch screen. If possible, I would stick with the 500e Gen4. [Officeworks sells a wide range of chromebooks](https://www.officeworks.com.au/shop/officeworks/search?q=chromebook) but they don't have any rugged ones, so I would stick with the Lenovo mentioned above.
  
Upgrade Pick: [ASUS Chromebook Plus CM34 Flip Ryzen 5 14" 8/256GB A$647](https://www.officeworks.com.au/shop/officeworks/p/asus-chromebook-plus-cm34-flip-ryzen-5-14-8-256gb-ascm340119)  
For older students, this is faster, but larger and not as robust as an education chromebook. This will handle all the web apps out there faster than any comparably priced windows laptop.  

I don't recommend this for younger kids, but for high school kids careful with their tech, this is a good buy.  
  
## When to buy a Windows or Mac laptop:  

Is your child video editing or building robots? In both cases, most schools use web platforms to edit videos or code in the cloud, but as your kid gets more advanced they probably want a faster better machine to run their code - but that also happens in the cloud these days, so frankly, 95% of kids will only use the cloud.
  
So if your child is in Yr 10-12 and wants a beefy laptop, first up congrats!
  
Mac: get the cheapest base model Macbook Air, which right now is a [M1 Macbook Air for ~1,349](https://www.apple.com/au-hed/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/13-inch-m1), or if splurging, a [M2 Macbook Air for A$1,649](https://www.apple.com/au-hed/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/13-inch-m2).  Make sure you get Apple's education discount of ~10%. If the M3 is out, than add 1 to these recommendations, i.e M2 for the budget pick and M3 for the upgrade.


:::note[Upgrade memory to 16gb for video editing]
If video editing, you need to upgrade to 16 gig of Ram and an external 2TB SSD.  
:::
  
Windows: This is both easier and trickier, as there are a lot of very crappy but looking good on the surface Windows laptops out there.  
  
Budget Pick: [Acer Aspire 3 Spin 14 ~A$600](https://www.officeworks.com.au/shop/officeworks/p/acer-14-spin-3-2-in-1-laptop-n200-8-128gb-silver-ackensa006)  
  
Personally, I wouldn't inflict any windows laptop <1K on a student. If you really need Windows, think A$900 and above. The cheapest decent Windows laptop I found is:  
  
Any of the Lenovo Yoga laptops in the ~14 inch size, e.g Lenevo Yoga 6 (13", Gen 8) AMD ~A$1,000 on sale  
  
Upgrade Pick: Framework 13 inch  
  
Video/Gaming pick:  
The primarily reason to spend more than 1K is running AAA games or Video Editing. For gaming, just get a console, for video editing:

Budget pick: This is difficult. Frankly consider using cloud video editors like [Adobe Rush](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/premiere-rush.html) for smaller projects. Adobe gets nice student discounts, so why not use those.

Upgrade pick: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2024 model)
